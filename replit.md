## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Arulselvan M, a software developer. The project is a static website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a modern design with a purple color scheme and smooth animations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static Website**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: All content is contained within a single HTML file with JavaScript-driven navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Modern CSS**: Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks or libraries, pure DOM manipulation

### Design System
- **Color Palette**: Purple-based theme with comprehensive color variables
- **Typography**: Inter font family from Google Fonts
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing scale using CSS custom properties
- **Component-Based CSS**: Modular CSS structure with clear naming conventions

## Key Components

### Navigation System
- Fixed navigation bar with scroll effects
- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Active link highlighting based on scroll position
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu

### Hero Section
- Animated typing effect for dynamic text display
- Gradient backgrounds and modern typography
- Call-to-action elements

### Interactive Features
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Mobile menu toggle functionality
- Contact form with validation
- Smooth page transitions

## Data Flow

### Client-Side Only
- No backend server or database
- All interactions handled through JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Form submissions likely handled through client-side validation
- State management through vanilla JavaScript

### Event-Driven Architecture
- DOM event listeners for user interactions
- Scroll event handling for navigation and animations
- Form submission and validation events
- Mobile menu toggle events

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for typography
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements (version 6.0.0)
- **CDN Delivery**: External resources loaded via CDN

### No Backend Dependencies
- No database connections
- No server-side processing
- No API integrations
- Pure client-side implementation

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
- **Deployment Method**: Static file hosting (suitable for GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- **Build Process**: No build step required - direct file serving
- **Assets**: All assets (CSS, JS, images) are locally referenced
- **Performance**: Minimal loading requirements with external font and icon CDNs

### Optimization Considerations
- CSS and JS could be minified for production
- Images should be optimized for web delivery
- Font loading optimization through font-display properties
- Potential for CSS/JS bundling in future iterations

## Development Notes

### Code Structure
- Modular JavaScript with clear function separation
- CSS organized with logical grouping and consistent naming
- HTML semantic structure for accessibility
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Add build process with bundling and minification
- Implement service worker for offline capabilities
- Add progressive web app (PWA) features
- Integrate with a headless CMS for content management
- Add analytics tracking
- Implement contact form backend integration
